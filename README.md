# **Project Initialization and Requirement Gathering**

-   Our project revolves around building a 16-bit Virtual Environment to facilitate the creation and execution of programs.

-   **Objectives:**

    -   Develop a virtual environment with components like CPU and Memory.
    -   Implement an instruction set with its own assembler.
    -   Create a programming language basedour instruction set to build applications.

-   **Learning Outcomes:**

    -   Gain a deeper understanding of computer architecture and logical operations.
    -   Explore the inner workings of programming languages.
    -   Apply and enhance low-level programming skills using C.
